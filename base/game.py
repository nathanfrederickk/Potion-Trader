For this game class, we're using the hash table for the set_total_potion_data to store all potions with quantity/litre
0, using the potion_name as key and potion object as the item. A hash table is used because we are allowed to
assume that all hash operations take constant time. An AVL tree data structure is used in add_potions_to_inventory,
where the key is the the buy_price while the item contains the potion object. We choose the AVL tree data structure
here because we need to select the kth most expensive potion based on a random number generated in
choose_potions_for_vendors using the kth_largest() method in avl.py.

                           have, we will then take the maximum liters from the vendor, but if the result is lesser than
                           what the vendors have, we will take what we have counted. To calculate how much we can earn,
